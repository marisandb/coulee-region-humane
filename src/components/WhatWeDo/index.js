            <h3>We are currently licensed to rehab the following animals:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Turtles</li>
                <li>Squirrels</li>
                <li>Rabbits</li>
                <li>Foxes</li>
                <li>Opossums</li>
                <li>Bats</li>
                <li>Ducklings</li>
                <li>Birds</li>
                <li>Birds of prey</li>
                <li>And others... </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            We can occasionally take in other animals not listed here to be transferred to other in-state facilities, however, this is on a case-to-case basis. If you find an injured animal that is not on this list, please contact us for guidance on how to proceed. Each year we take in many animals with broken wings, orphaned babies, and a variety of other injuries and situations and are able to rehab these animals and release them where they were found. In the unfortunate cases where animals can not be rehabbed, due to extensive injuries, they are humanely euthanized by a certified professional.

            <h2>Rescue</h2>
            <p>
            Animal control often receives calls for distressed/injured wildlife and domestic animals. We try our best to assist the animals we can. It is to be noted that outside of nets and catchpoles our officers do not have access to special equipment such as boats or ladders. For safety reasons our officers will not climb ladders or put themself in dangerous situations. Our most common animal rescue is removing ducks from storm drains.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
            Wildlife is often misunderstood and because of that may be mistreated. Our goal is to educate the public on the importance of our wild neighbors. We can offer advice on how to handle nuisance wildlife humanely. We also enjoy teaching our community about the many animals we intake. Most recently our educational skunk Flower who will help curb the fear surrounding these cute but stinky animals.
