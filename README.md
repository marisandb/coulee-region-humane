# Coulee Region Humane Society Wildlife

## Description

Our local wildlife rehab shares a website with the humane society. They are given a small tab with little infomration about the work they do. I was tasked with building them a website of their own. This website provides information on what they do, who they are, and to share some success stories.

A thank you to the board of directors at Coulee Region Humane Society who allowed me to build this website. An even bigger thanks to Kathy Kasa Kaitas, the animal control supervisor, for supplying me with some wonderful wildlife photos and stories.
